# Project Stolen Bikes - Join Coding Challenge


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## SURGE LINK

[SURGE](lamentable-action.surge.sh)

## What Works?

### `List of reported bike thefts for the Berlin area`

You can see a list of reported bike thefts for the Berlin area.

### `The first 10 bike theft cases`

You can see the first 10 bike theft cases and select 1, 10 or 20 cases per page.

### `The total number of cases by the number of pages`

The number of pages makes it possible to estimate the total number of theft cases.

### `Case details`



For each reported bike theft, you can see: 
- Case title
- Case description
- Date of theft
- Location of the theft
- Picture of the bike when available. 
**Note: when the picture is not available, a bike icon is shown**


## What DOES NOT work?

### Filter bike thefts by date rage

Seems like the link given for the API is an older unavailable version. The current version does not support filtering by date range.

## Learn More

- You can search for the case you want in the search area.
- There's loading states until the list is available
- There's an error state when something goes wrong with the requests.
- There's an empty state when there's no results..
